# JS Starter project

Just the most basic template that I use for all my JS projects. Uses rollup (just easier and better than webpack imo) and has all the boilerplate for a live server (using sirv-cli) and hot reloading. Is also commented to remind myself in two weeks what all those plugins do and why do I need then. I hate not understanding config files.

It does not uses any rollup plugin to auto-generate the index.html file, because I just don't like it.
